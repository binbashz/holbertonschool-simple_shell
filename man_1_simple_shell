my_sh \- a simple shell program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B my_sh
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION
my_sh is a simple shell program that can execute both internal and external commands. This program reads input from the user,
 determines whether the command entered is an internal or external command, and executes it accordingly.

.SH OPTIONS

To use my_sh, simply run the program in the command line. Once the program is running, a prompt message will be displayed. Enter a command and
 press Enter to execute it. There are two types of commands that can be executed: internal commands and external commands.

Internal commands are built into the shell program, and are executed by the execute_internal_command function. 
To execute an internal command, simply enter the command name and any required arguments. The following internal commands are available:




.PP
.B exit
Exits the shell program.

External commands are not built into the shell program, and are executed by the execute_external_command function.
 To execute an external command, enter the command name and any required arguments.
 The command will be executed in a child process, and the output will be displayed in the shell program.
 If the command fails to execute, an error message will be displayed.

.SH FUNCTIONS
This program contains the following functions:

.PP
.B execute_external_command
Executes a command not built into the shell program. This function creates a child process and attempts to execute the command specified in the argv array. 
If successful, the child process will run the command and then terminate. The parent process will wait for the child to complete execution before terminating.

.PP
.B execute_internal_command
Executes a command built into the shell program. This function handles internal shell commands such as  "exit".

.TP
.PP
.B main
Entry point for the shell program. This function contains the main loop for the shell program.
 It prints a prompt message, reads input from the user, and determines whether the command entered is an internal or
 external command. Internal commands are executed by calling the execute_internal_command function, and external
 commands are executed by calling the execute_external_command function.
