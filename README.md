## C - Simple Shell		

Write a UNIX command line interpreter.


Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
Handle errors.
You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D).


The shell is the interface between the user and the operating system.

The shell is an executable file (program) that acts as an intermediary between the operating system and the user who enters commands in text mode.
Its function is to read the command line, interpret its meaning, execute the command and then output the result via the outputs.
